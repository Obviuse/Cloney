NExtra is an open-source library with extended functionality
for the .NET Framework.

I continously add new functionality that I create, no matter
which part of the .NET Framework it regards. Implementations
that I find in blog post or such will contain links to their
original implementations. 

Contributions to the library are more than welcome. Just let
me know if you want to help out in any way.
