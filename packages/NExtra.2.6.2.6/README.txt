NExtra
======

NExtra is an open-source library with extended functionality
for the .NET framework.

I continously add new things that I create in my other hobby
projects, if they are general enough and may help others out.

Stuff that I find in blog post or such will contain links to
the original implementation and author. 


Getting started
---------------

To get started with NExtra, grab the source code from GitHub
or download the pre-compiled DLLs from the download page.

The demo project is out of date. It may work for some of the
classes, but most will fail.
