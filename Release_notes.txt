Cloney 0.4.0.0		2011-10-09
==============================

In this version, focus has been on structural changes and some
minor UI changes. The two applications should work like before,
except that the command line application is more tolerant when
it handles input arguments. It is now possible to use either /
or \\ when specifying folder paths. In earlier versions, / did
cause the application to crash.

If you download the source code, you will probably notice that
Cloney has less classes now than before. The reason to this is
that Cloney now uses the NExtra library instead of duplicating
the classes that already exists there.
