Cloney
======

Cloney is a Windows application that lets you clone .NET
solutions with a few clicks.

To use Cloney, just select a source folder that contains
the original solution, a target folder to which it is to
be cloned, then click a button and you're done.

Cloney is currently being developed and fine-tuned a bit,
but will soon be available for download.

Since no one has taken contact with me yet, I assume that
I can be lazy and work in a slooow pace that fits me. You
need to prove me wrong :)
