Cloney
======

Cloney is a Windows application that lets you clone .NET
solutions with a few clicks. Just select a source folder
that contains the original solution, as well as a target
folder that should contain the clone, click a button and
you're done.

Cloney is currently being developed and fine-tuned a bit,
but will soon be available for download.

I can be lazy and work in a slooow pace that fits me. You
need to prove me wrong :)
