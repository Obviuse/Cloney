Cloney
======

Cloney is a Windows application that lets you clone .NET
solutions with a few clicks. 

Cloney copies all files and folders from a source folder
to a a target folder and replaces the old namespace with
the new one. It ignores some folders and files (e.g. git
and svn) and leaves you with a solution, without a trace
of unwanted old stuff.

To use Cloney, just select a source folder that contains
the original solution, a target folder to which it is to
be cloned, then click a button and you're done.

Since no one has taken contact with me yet, I assume that
I can be lazy and work in a slow pace that fits me. Prove
me wrong :)
